# Laptop analysis
This repository contains analysis of laptops I made using Python and Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib libraries.
I also performed a statistical analysis using the scipy.stats module.

The data was downloaded from the website kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammetvarl/laptop-price).
